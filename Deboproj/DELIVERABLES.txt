✓ Create, sign, and execute proposals
✓ Time-locked proposal execution
✓ Batch transaction support (max 50 per batch)
✓ Dynamic signer management (add/remove)
✓ Emergency freeze procedures
✓ Complete audit trail logging
✓ Treasury state introspection

POLICY SYSTEM (6 TYPES):
✓ Spending Limit Policy
  - Daily/Weekly/Monthly limits
  - Per-category limits
  - Global limits
  - Max per transaction caps

✓ Whitelist Policy
  - Approved recipients
  - Blacklist support
  - Temporary entries with expiration

✓ Category Policy
  - Predefined categories (Operations, Marketing, Development, Research, Security, Other)
  - Required category assignment
  - Category-specific thresholds

✓ Time-Lock Policy
  - Base lock duration per category
  - Amount-based lock calculations
  - Configurable formula support

✓ Amount Threshold Policy
  - Dynamic threshold based on amount ranges
  - Automatic threshold escalation
